The best way to view this project is to view it from nbviewer/or mybinder badges above. As github can't read certain markdown syntax in jupyter notebook. 

### Briefly on the project:
The project focuses on the regularization Method LASSO, properties thereof and the settings in which it is used. The commonly sought-after method in high-dimensional data-setttings is LASSO, and why OLS fails in being a stable estimator in such settings is explained in the Section 2. The sections thereafter build the intution and mathematical derivation of LASSO. In the sections that follow, I have used as much as 5 Simulations to shed light on different properties of LASSO, comparing it to other linear regression methods as OLS and Ridge. Before concluding the project, I used a real data set-up to show how LASSO is helpful in high-dimensional data-settings, which I referred in Section 2.
